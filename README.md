# Hey, Welcome to my first repl Email Marketing Python

### How to use??
 - To use the repl , First of all you have to create an account on any email provider's website like mailgun or godaddy.
 - After creating an account, you have to find your email details or the credentials by which you're going to log in like your username and pasword, and also make sure to find the smtp address and port of the service you are using, Since I am using mailgun , So in my case it is 'smtp.mailgun.org' and Port is 587. It may vary or differ with other providers.
 - Now Enter the values as asked by the program. If you want to add multiple recievers seperate them by spaces.
 - You can use variables in message and email input like {email} etc or custom variables also as message is a f string.
 - Finally Now add environment variables named email , password, Smtp , Port containing your email or username, password, smtp address and Smtp port repectively.


## Now run your project !!
